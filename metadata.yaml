description: "Sir Gibbie is an 1879 novel by the Scottish author George MacDonald.\
  \ It is notable for its Doric dialogue, but has been criticised, especially by members\
  \ of the Scottish Renaissance, for being part of the kailyard movement. Despite\
  \ this there are far more who claim the book paints a fair view of urban as well\
  \ as rural life. The book doesn't seem to dwell as long on physical geography as\
  \ it does on the spiritual geography of the soul.\nMacDonald's editor, Elizabeth\
  \ Yates wrote of Sir Gibbie, \"It moved me the way books did when, as a child, the\
  \ great gates of literature began to open and first encounters with noble thoughts\
  \ and utterances were unspeakably thrilling.\"\nThe book shows a complex cast of\
  \ characters from all the social levels: from the laird to the homeless, going through\
  \ a couple of priests, one of them prone to yield to worldly considerations, although\
  \ he's good enough, or clever enough, not to fall into wickedness; the other merely\
  \ pompous and self-righteous. The aim of the story is to show that the idea that\
  \ bad people are the almost inevitable result of unjust social treatment is wrong.\n\
  Wee Sir Gibbie has all the numbers to become one of the dregs of society: a drunkard\
  \ father; as a child he gets in a den of assassins; in rags and poverty, he flies\
  \ away; then he is punished for having done good to others. But he grows to become\
  \ a Christ-figure, a knight-errant, a wrong-righter.\nIn 1937, the novel was included\
  \ in an influential list of notable English language literature entitled Literary\
  \ Taste: How to Form It (second edition).\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
